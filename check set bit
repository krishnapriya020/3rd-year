check set bit
bit is called set-bit if it is 1
use left shift(1<<k) for the another binary number to perform in and operation
use and operator,if answer is all 0s then it is not a set bit
                 if answer include 1 then it is a set bit
#code
n=int(input())
k=int(input())
    if((n&(1<<k))==0):
        return False
    return True
